# Botify.

Botify is a bot marketplace that connects developers and users. It uses 
the new [ERC6551 NFT Bound accounts](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551) that allows us to create NFTs that
can own assets on the blockchain. We combine this 
feature with chainlink functions to create NFT tokens that can execute
some piece of software in exchange for tokens. 

Currently users can create *pay-as-you-go bots*, where users pay for each
request made (kind of like Lambda functions in the AWS ecosystem), 
and *AI bots* which let's devs define *system prompts* that will
then be used by LLMs to create AI agents which help users with any 
problems they might have.

Botify has an API that allows third-party applications to interact with any
bot on the platform. Using this developers can access blockchain functions in their own 
application without having to learn about smart contract development, an easy 
and fast way to onboard new users into web3!

## Features 
* 🛒 **p2p marketplace** makes it easy and cheaper for users to interact with software products.
* ✨ **Easy to use:** As a user everything you have everything you need in one UI. As a developer/vendor the 
UI does alot of the deployment for you.
* ⛓️ **Client side encryption**: The website doesn't store any secrets in a centralised database.
* *💸 *User defined pricing:** Users pay a fee defined by the vendor, if this is to high 
another vendor will create a cheaper product where the users will then go. This 
competition leads to an effective market.
* 📖 **Open**: As a p2p marketplace the UI is just there to make things simpler, any user can
create+deploy their own contracts that users can interact with. Anyone can create their 
own Botify UI forks, kind of like Uniswap.
* 📈 **Trendy**: The GPT store is still in the back of everyones minds, this will 
be a concept many will understand.
