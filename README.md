# Botify.

Botify is a bot marketplace that connects developers and users. It uses 
the new IERC6551 ethereum contract which allows us to create NFTs that
acts as contracts which can own assets on the blockchain. We combine this 
feature with chainlink functions to create NFT tokens that can execute
software in exchange for tokens. 

Currently users can create pay-as-you-go bots, where users pay for each
request made, and AI bots which let's devs define *system prompts* that will
then be used by LLMs to create AI agents to help users with any problems they might
have.

Botify supports third-party interactions by exposing a web3 endpoint to access
a bot. Using this endpoint users access blockchain functions in their own 
application without having to learn about smart contract development, an easy 
and fast way to onboard new users into web3!

## Features 
* 🛒 **p2p marketplace** makes it easy and cheaper for users to interact with chainlink
functions.
* ✨ **Easy to use:** As a users everything you need is in one UI. As a developer/vendor the 
UI does alot of the deployment for you.
* ⛓️ **Client side encryption**: The website doesn't store any secrets in a centralised database.
* **User defined pricing:** Users pay a fee defined by the vendor, if this is to high 
another vendor will create a cheaper product where the users will then go. This 
competition leads to an effective market.
* 💸 **Open**: As a p2p marketplace the UI is just there to make things simpler, any user can
create+deploy their own contracts that users can interact with. This makes it censorship resistant.
* 📈 **Trendy**: The GPT store is in the back of everyones minds, this will 
be a concept many will understand.
